## 📊 How It Works

### Homepage Display:
- Shows **only featured projects** (not all projects)
- Maximum of **3 projects** displayed
- Projects appear in the order they were created
- If no projects are featured, homepage shows "No projects yet" message

### Projects Page:
- Shows **all projects** (both featured and non-featured)
- Featured status doesn't affect this page

## 💡 Best Practices

### How Many to Feature?
- **Recommended**: 3 projects (fills the homepage grid perfectly)
- **Minimum**: 1 project
- **Maximum**: Technically unlimited, but only first 3 show

### Which Projects to Feature?
✅ Your best work
✅ Most recent projects
✅ Projects that showcase diverse skills
✅ Projects with complete documentation
✅ Projects with high-quality images

### Tips:
1. **Update regularly** - Rotate featured projects to keep homepage fresh
2. **Quality over quantity** - Better to feature 2 great projects than 3 mediocre ones
3. **Complete information** - Featured projects should have:
   - High-quality main image
   - Gallery images
   - Detailed description
   - Tools and outcomes listed
   - PDF documentation (if available)
